# spaceflights

## Overview

This is your new Kedro project for the [spaceflights tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.html), which was generated using `Kedro 0.18.7`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `src/requirements.txt` for `pip` installation and `src/environment.yml` for `conda` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## How to visualize the pipelines in Kedro project

Kedro-Viz is a key part of Kedro. It visualises the pipelines in a Kedro project by showing data, nodes, and the connections between them.

The Kedro-Viz package needs to be installed separately as it is not part of the standard Kedro installation 

```
pip install kedro-viz
```

To start Kedro-Viz, type the following into your terminal from the project directory:

```
kedro viz
```
The command opens a browser tab to serve the visualisation at `http://127.0.0.1:4141/`.

### Automatic visualisation updates

You can use the `--autoreload` flag to autoreload Kedro-Viz when a `Python` or `YAML` file changes in the project. Add the flag to the command you use to start Kedro-Viz:

```
kedro viz --autoreload
```

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### How to convert notebook cells to nodes in a Kedro project
You can move notebook code over into a Kedro project structure using a mixture of [cell tagging](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#cell-tags) and Kedro CLI commands.

By adding the `node` tag to a cell and running the command below, the cell's source code will be copied over to a Python file within `src/<package_name>/nodes/`:

```
kedro jupyter convert <filepath_to_my_notebook>
```
> *Note:* The name of the Python file matches the name of the original notebook.

Alternatively, you may want to transform all your notebooks in one go. Run the following command to convert all notebook files found in the project root directory and under any of its sub-folders:

```
kedro jupyter convert --all
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can run `kedro activate-nbstripout`. This will add a hook in `.git/config` which will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
